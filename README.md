## Target Markdown and stantargets for Bayesian model validation pipelines

The `targets` package is a pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. Pipelines with `targets` skip costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, run the necessary computation with implicit parallel computing, and abstract files as R objects. In this way, `targets` enhances the reproducibility, scale, and maintainability of data science projects in computationally intense fields such as machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and statistical genomics. Domain-specific extensions to `targets` make it easier to write specialized pipelines, and Target Markdown leverages literate programming for pipeline specification. This talk overviews these capabilities, with an emphasis on Bayesian data analysis.
